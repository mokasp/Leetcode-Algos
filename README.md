## Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

**Description:**
Given a sorted array `nums`, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

## Two Sum

**Description:**
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Maximum Subarray

**Description:**
Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

## Container With Most Water

**Description:**
Given n non-negative integers `a1, a2, ..., an`, where each represents a point at coordinate `(i, ai)`. n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line `i` are at `(i, ai)` and `(i, 0)`. Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis, forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

## Find All Duplicates in an Array

**Description:**
Given an array of integers, `nums`, 1 ≤ `nums[i]` ≤ `n` (where `n` is the size of the array), some elements appear twice and others appear once. Find all the elements that appear twice in the array.

## Valid Sudoku

**Description:**
Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules: Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition, each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition, and each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
